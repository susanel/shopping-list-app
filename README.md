# :moneybag: Shopping List App 

This project is made as a part of recruitment process.

## Description

This one is a simple React App.
You can add items to your shopping list, print them and you are ready to go! :relaxed:  
Also, your last shopping list is stored in a LocalStorage, so if you turn off the website accidently - no prob!

## Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS (preprocesor SASS)
- JS (+ React library)

## Future features

Because the time is short :alarm_clock:, I am going to add more features to it soon.

- The ability to edit a product from the list
- Drag & Drop mechanism to an product you want to edit
